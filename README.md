# Cloning this Repo

1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.
2. Open up a terminal on your computer (e.g. PowerShell).
3. (Optionally) Navigate your terminal to a folder of your choice. Your repo will be cloned into a new folder inside the current folder you are in.
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/steve-snow/overlake-uas4stem.git`

# Collabarating

You are using a `git` based repository. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-source **version control system** that most software developers use to collabarate.

While explaining every feature of git would take _way_ too long, I (C/Capt Randolph Halim) reccomend these two videos: [Git in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) and [GitHub Pull Requests in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4) (no more free stickers from the second video though...).
